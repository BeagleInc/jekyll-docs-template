###Getting Collaborative

By using the Add User icon in the top left of the page, underneath and to the left of the Parties, you can insert the email address of anyone to collaborate with.  They will get an email to collaborate.  When you click on your name in the top right, you will see all the documents you have uploaded.  Any document you have been invited to collaborate on will be green.
To add a new document, click on the Beagle icon in the top left of the page and follow the prompts.
