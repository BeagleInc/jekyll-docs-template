###Agreement

This view gives you the entire agreement highlighted with the four areas Beagle looked for, including any comments, or changes to any other clause.  It is a great way to view or access other clauses of the entire document.

###All Clauses

There is a table called All Clauses.  This allows you to see in a table view all clauses identified.  Redlines are not yet viewable in this view, but will be shortly.  This is a great way to comment on clauses and export it as a CSV file to be able to distribute to your team if they do not want to use the web interface.
