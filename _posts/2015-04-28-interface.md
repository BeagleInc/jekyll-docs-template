###Loading

You document may take a while to load, convert, and process.  (i.e. a minute or two).  You should get an email telling you when the analysis is done.  Otherwise just wait and see the analysis screen show the results.

###The Report Page

First you will see a popup on the lower right side saying Welcome to Beagle.  This is your interactive support for any questions you have.  Just type in a New Message and a member from our team will respond via email, or if they are online, in the chat window.  This is the best please to get help.  

###Party Identification

In the top left you will see the Parties that Beagle figured out.  Unfortunately Beagle does not always get the parties correct.    You can move your mouse over top of the parties to see what confidence Beagle has with respect to the parties it identified.  We will very shortly have a way for you to manually change them if Beagle is incorrect.

###Collaboration

Below and to the left of the Parties you will see two icons.  The one on the right allows you to invite another person to collaborate.  Once you click on the icon you can fill in their email address and click ADD.  An email invitation to only that user, and document will be sent.  You may remove them just as easy.  Just click on the red X over their icon once they have joined. See (Invitation)[./doc/invitation.html] for more information.

###Analysis

You will see 4 “windows” each representing a graph or table of the 4 key areas we search.  Responsibilities, Liabilities, Terminations and External References.  On the Liabilities move your mouse of the “i” in the corner for an explanation overlay.  For Terminations move your mouse over terminations and see the relative termination rights of each party.
