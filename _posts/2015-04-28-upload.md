Upload
======

Go to [beta.beagle.ai](https://beta.beagle.ai) to upload a document.  You can upload a PDF (Text Readable),  DOCX, and TXT.  Unfortunately .doc will not retain formatting at this time when you export.  But it will work for analysis. Finally we are testing a few OCR options, and will let you know very soon when we have it working for testing.

You may upload from local,  Google Drive, or Dropbox.
