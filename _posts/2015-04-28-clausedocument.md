Digging Deeper
--------------
You can click on each of the graphs to bring up a list of the clauses, Beagle identified.  Click on any clause and it will bring you to the relevant spot in the contract.   You will notice that each section is colour coded.  Only those clauses in the area you have clicked to view will be shown highlighted on the right hand side.  

Each section can be accessed from the L R T or E buttons on the top left side of the clause list.  This allows you instant access to those groups of clauses in context.

Approval/Disaproval
--------------------
Select the area you want to see clauses for.  Now scroll through the clauses.  You may click on the check mark or the X to like or dislike the clause.  You can also add a comment to the end of the clause by filling in the comment field.  We will very shortly have an invitation to a specific clause section.

Editing
-------
In addition you can click on the clause to bring up an edit window.  Modify whatever text you like and click save.  The modification will be treated like a track changes in your current word processing application.  The person who uploads the document is the only one who can accept changes.
